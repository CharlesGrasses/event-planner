A React-based event management platform designed to streamline the organization of various social gatherings, from intimate parties to large-scale concerts. At its core, the platform features an intuitive calendar interface that serves as the main navigation hub. Users can seamlessly switch between monthly and weekly views, allowing them to focus on their preferred time frame.

The calendar displays event titles directly on each date, providing an immediate overview of upcoming activities. When users select a specific date, the platform presents a comprehensive list of all events scheduled for that day through an elegant modal interface. Each event entry acts as a gateway to more detailed information, accessible through a secondary modal that reveals the complete event profile.

This detailed view encompasses all essential event information, including the precise date and time, expected duration, event name, and a thorough description. Additional crucial details such as age restrictions, maximum attendance capacity, organizer contact information, and venue location are clearly presented. Organizers also have the option to enhance their event listings by including a featured image at the top of the description.

To help users manage their priorities, the platform incorporates a favoriting system. Users can mark events as favorites directly from the event description modal, effectively creating a curated collection of their most important or interesting events. The main calendar view includes filtering capabilities that allow users to toggle between displaying all events or exclusively showing their favorited selections, making it simple to focus on what matters most to them.
